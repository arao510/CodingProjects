Welcome! This repository serves as a curated portfolio of selected programming projects developed using C, C++, Python.
It highlights my proficiency in systems programming, object-oriented design, data structures, and machine learning frameworks.

C Projects:
- Memory management, pointer-based algorithms
- Custom data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues)
- File I/O and low-level I/O operations
  
C++ Projects
- Object-oriented design patterns
- STL-based algorithms and containers
- Performance-focused implementations

Python/Pytorch Projects:
- Data wrangling and scripting utilities
- Clean, readable, modular Python code
- Deep learning models for image and/or text
- Custom training loops and evaluation pipelines
- Hands-on experiments with CNNs, RNNs, transformers, etc.

How to Navigate:
Each folder contains:
- Source code
- A brief `README.md` for that project
- Example inputs/outputs (where applicable)
